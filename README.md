The project was part of "Advanced Object Oriented Programming" course.  
The purpose of the project is to simulate to "Corona Pandemic" from a given file with initialization information about cities.

The simulation will be based on statistics formulas and various calculations - based on:
  1. Corona mutation variant.
  2. Distance between two persons.
  3. Type of settlement and settlement density.

The project is written in **Java** with the basics and advanced principles of the **Object Oriented Programming**, simulating with Java **Threads**, **Design Patterns** and **Java GUI** concepts.


## This is the starting map:
  All the settlements are Green.
